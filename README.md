# Optimization Algorithms: BMR and BWR

This package implements two simple yet powerful optimization algorithms:
- **BMR (Best-Mean-Random) Algorithm**
- **BWR (Best-Worst-Random) Algorithm**

These algorithms are designed to solve both **constrained** and **unconstrained** optimization problems without relying on metaphors or algorithm-specific parameters. The package is based on the paper:

**Ravipudi Venkata Rao and Ravikumar Shah (2024)**, "BMR and BWR: Two simple metaphor-free optimization algorithms for solving real-life non-convex constrained and unconstrained problems." [arXiv:2407.11149v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11149).

## Features

- **Metaphor-Free**: No reliance on nature-inspired metaphors.
- **Simple**: No algorithm-specific parameters to tune.
- **Flexible**: Handles both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems.
  
## Installation

You can install this package directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install optimization_algorithms
